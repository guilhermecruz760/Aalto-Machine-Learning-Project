Dear Mercedes-Benz.io recruiting team,

**Few things motivate me more than writing code that silently improves and powers great user experiences.** This has led me to apply for your Backend Engineer Summer Internship. I want to contribute to scalable backend systems while learning from a company like Mercedes-Benz and its renowned industrial engineering.

Last year I was a Python teacher at **SharkCoders**, where I taught Python to some brilliant young minds. This had a great impact on me, sharpening both my fluency and my ability to explain complex backend concepts clearly.

Last summer, I completed an internship at **FiberSight**, a CERN start-up developing a novel kilometer-range distributed fiber sensor. Alongside other interns, we built a web app to present soil moisture and temperature data to end users. Collaboratively working in a small team, we used GitHub for version control and Markdown for producing all necessary documentation.

Right now, I’m finishing a **yearlong exchange program at Aalto University in Finland** — a highly international environment — which I truly believe has strengthened my ability to adapt to multicultural teams and diverse ways of thinking, both technically and interpersonally.

As a Backend Engineer Intern at Mercedes-Benz.io, I’m eager to:

- Contribute to the development of reliable backend services that support seamless digital experiences.  
- Learn and apply modern engineering practices while working in an agile, collaborative team environment.  
- Uphold strong coding hygiene, testing rigor, and security awareness — all of which I’ve practiced through unit tests, Git versioning, and code review loops.  
- Engage in meaningful technical discussions and support the design of backend features that are practical, scalable, and user-focused.

I believe agile teams will offer me the ideal environment to thrive, learn, and contribute – especially now as I complete my last year in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I would love the opportunity to further discuss how my background and passion can support your backend team.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to connecting.

**Warm regards,**  
Guilherme Cruz
