\section{Introduction}
Machine learning has consistently demonstrated its utility and power in addressing real-world problems across a wide range of fields. When it comes to evaluating performance, particularly academic grade performance, numerous variables must be taken into account.

In this study, we will train our machine learning (ML) models using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. These models will aid both students and educators in understanding which factors most significantly influence students' grades.

Our report will begin with a Problem Formulation section, where we will clearly define the problem and outline how we intend to leverage ML models to address it. Following this, a Methods section will provide a detailed analysis of the models considered and their evaluation based on criteria such as accuracy.

In the Results section, we will present the outcomes derived from our models, followed by an in-depth analysis. Finally, the key findings will be synthesized and summarized in the Conclusion section.
